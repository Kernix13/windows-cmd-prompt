# The most useful command prompt commands

These are for the old cmd prompt. Check the `PowerShell.md` file for those commands. The actual cmd prompt commands are in `CmdPrompt.md`. I also have notes on `.bat` files in `BatchCommands.md`.

Compare the commands in this repo in my repo [bash-shell-scripts](https://github.com/Kernix13/bash-shell-scripts) as there are commands in common to both repos.
